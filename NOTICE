Its source code is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License**

### Informal summary (this does *not* replace the actual license)

- You may use, study, modify, and redistribute this code.
- If you distribute the app (for example on Google Play),
  you must also provide the **full corresponding source code**
  under an **AGPL-compatible license**.
- If you run this app as a network service, users of that service must be
  able to obtain the corresponding source code as well.

The app depends on **iText Core for Android 9.x** libraries
(`com.itextpdf.android:*`). These libraries are themselves licensed under
**AGPL-3.0** (or available under a separate commercial license).

If someone wants to use this project **without AGPL**, in a closed-source app,
they must obtain their **own commercial iText license**. In that scenario,
they are responsible for complying with their license terms; this repository
is provided as an example only.
